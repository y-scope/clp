# Using CLP's core through a container

To quickly try CLP's core compression, decompression, and search (outside of the package), you can
use the [clp-core-x86-ubuntu-focal][1] container as follows.

1. Pull the container image:

    ```shell
    docker pull ghcr.io/y-scope/clp/clp-core-x86-ubuntu-focal:main
    ```

2. Start the container with mounts for your logs and output directories:
   > [!NOTE]
   > Be sure to change the paths in the command below before running it.

    ```shell
    docker run \
      --rm \
      -it \
      -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
      --volume /my/logs/dir:/mnt/logs \
      --volume /my/data/dir:/mnt/data \
      ghcr.io/y-scope/clp/clp-core-x86-ubuntu-focal:main /bin/bash
    ```

   * Change `/my/logs/dir` to the directory on your machine that contains the logs you wish to
     compress. It will be mounted at `/mnt/logs` in the container.
   * Change `/my/data/dir` to the directory on your machine where you want to store the generated
     archives. It will be mounted at `/mnt/data` in the container.

3. Follow the usage instructions in [Using CLP for unstructured logs](clp-unstructured.md) or
   [Using CLP for semi-structured logs](clp-structured.md), depending on your use case.
