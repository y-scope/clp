# clp-s

The compressed-log-processor-structured (abbreviated `clp-s`, also known as [Î¼Slope][Î¼Slope])
archive format is a storage format for large chunks of dynamically-structured (e.g., JSON) logs.
Compared to the [KV-IR](../design-kv-ir-streams/index.md) streaming compression format, `clp-s`
achieves higher compression ratios and significantly faster search speeds. To accomplish this, `clp-s` needs to
aggregate log data before compressing the data into archives. In addition, it requires memory proportional to
archive size for both compression and search. These constraints make `clp-s` unsuitable for real-time or severely
resource-constrained usage, but ideal for long-term archival and search.
