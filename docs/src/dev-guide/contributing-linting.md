# Linting

Before submitting a PR, ensure you've run our linting tools and either fixed any violations or
suppressed the warning. If you can't run the linting workflows locally, you can enable and run the
[clp-lint] and [clp-core-build] workflows in your fork.

## Requirements

We currently support running our linting tools on Linux and macOS. If you're developing on another
OS, you can submit a [feature request][feature-req], or use our [clp-lint] workflow in your fork.

To run the linting tools, besides commonly installed tools like `tar`, you'll need:

* `curl`
* `md5sum`
* Python 3.8 or newer
* python3-venv
* [Task] >= 3.38.0

## Running the linters

To perform the linting checks:

```shell
task lint:check
```

To also apply any automatic fixes:

```shell
task lint:fix
```
