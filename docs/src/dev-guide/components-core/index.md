# Core

CLP core is the low-level component that performs compression, decompression, and search.

## Requirements

* We have built and tested CLP on the OSes listed [below](#native-environment).
  * If you have trouble building for another OS, file an issue, and we may be able to help.
* A recent compiler that fully supports C++20 features such as
  * std::span
  * std::source_location
* [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) >= 3.38.0

To build, we require some source dependencies, packages from package managers, and libraries built
from source.

### Set up

To initialize the project, run:

```shell
tools/scripts/deps-download/init.sh
```

### Source Dependencies

We use both git submodules and third-party source packages. To download all, run this `task`
command:

```shell
task deps:core
```

This will download:
* [abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) (20230802.1)
* [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org) (v4.13.1)
* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git) (v2.13.7)
* [date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date.git) (v3.0.1)
* [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git) (v3.11.3)
* [log-surgeon](https://github.com/y-scope/log-surgeon.git) (895f464)
* [outcome](https://github.com/ned14/outcome) (v2.2.9)
* [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson) (v3.6.3)
* [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) (v3.36.0)
* [uftcpp](https://github.com/nemtrif/utfcpp.git) (v4.0.6)
* [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git) (v0.7.0)
* [yscope-log-viewer](https://github.com/y-scope/yscope-log-viewer.git) (969ff35)
* [ystdlib-cpp](https://github.com/y-scope/ystdlib-cpp.git) (2ac1757)

### Environment

A handful of packages and libraries are required to build CLP. There are two options to use them:

* Install them on your machine and build CLP natively
* Build CLP within a prebuilt docker container that contains the libraries;
  However, this won't work if you need additional libraries that aren't already in the container.

#### Native Environment

See the relevant README for your OS:

* [CentOS Stream 9](centos-stream-9-deps-install)
* [macOS](macos-deps-install)
* [Ubuntu 22.04](ubuntu-jammy-deps-install)

Want to build natively on an OS not listed here? You can file a [feature request][feature-req].

#### Docker Environment

You can use these commands to start a container in which you can build and run CLP:

```shell
# Make sure to change /path/to/clp/components/core and /path/to/my/logs below
docker run --rm -it \
  --name 'clp-build-env' \
  -u$(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v$(readlink -f /path/to/clp/components/core):/mnt/clp \
  -v$(readlink -f /path/to/my/logs):/mnt/logs \
  ghcr.io/y-scope/clp/clp-core-dependencies-x86-ubuntu-jammy:main \
  /bin/bash -l

cd /mnt/clp
```

Make sure to change `/path/to/clp/components/core` and `/path/to/my/logs` to
the relevant paths on your machine.

## Build

* Configure the cmake project:
  ```shell
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  ```

* Build:
  ```shell
  make -j
  ```
