# Specification

KV-IR streams are structured as shown in [Figure 1](#figure-1). It begins with a magic number,
followed by some metadata, the encoded log events, and finally an end-of-stream marker. Except for
the magic number, the stream is a series of *packets*, where each packet contains:

* a header byte indicating the packet type; and
* an optional payload, potentially containing other packets.

The rest of this page explains the individual components of the stream, highlighting any nontrivial
design choices.

## Magic number

The magic number appears first in the stream and is used to identify a file as a kv-ir stream.
There are two possible magic numbers:

* `0xFD2FB529` indicating the stream uses a four-byte encoding for encoded-text AST variables.
* `0xFD2FB530` indicating the stream uses an eight-byte encoding for encoded-text AST variables.
    
:::{warning}
The eight-byte encoding is being deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

## Metadata

The metadata section contains a single [JsonMetadata](#jsonmetadata-packet) packet containing
kv-pairs that describe the contents of the stream. Although JSON can hold values of different types,
the format requires that each key and value must be a string. The kv-pairs in [Table 1](#table-1)
are required while others may be added by applications as necessary.
