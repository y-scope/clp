# KV-IR streams

The key-value pair internal representation (abbreviated as KV-IR) stream format is a storage format
for dynamically structured (e.g., JSON) logs. Compared to a JSON file, the KV-IR stream format is
typically smaller and faster for clp-s to compress. Compared to clp-s' archive format, the KV-IR
stream format buffers less data in-memory, making it more suitable for use in resource-constrained
environments and low-latency use cases (e.g., logging libraries). This section describes the format
as well as the key design decisions behind it.
