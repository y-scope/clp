# Configuring CLP

To use object storage with CLP, follow the steps below to configure each use case you require.

:::{note}
If CLP is already running, shut it down, update its configuration, and then start it again.
:::

## Configuration for archive storage

To configure CLP to store archives on S3, update the `archive_output.storage` key in
`<package>/etc/clp-config.yml` with the values in the code block below, replacing the fields in
angle brackets (`<>`) with the appropriate values:

```yaml
archive_output:
  storage:
    type: "s3"
    staging_directory: "var/data/staged-archives"  # Or a path of your choosing
    s3_config:
      region_code: "<region-code>"
      bucket: "<bucket-name>"
      key_prefix: "<key-prefix>"
      credentials:
        access_key_id: "<aws-access-key-id>"
        secret_access_key: "<aws-secret-access-key>"

  # archive_output's other config keys
```

* `staging_directory` is the local filesystem directory where archives will be temporarily stored
  before being uploaded to S3.
* `s3_config` configures both the S3 bucket where archives should be stored and the credentials
  for accessing it.
  * `<region-code>` is the AWS region [code][aws-region-codes] for the bucket.
  * `<bucket-name>` is the bucket's name.
  * `<key-prefix>` is the "directory" where all archives will be stored within the bucket and
    must end with trailing forward slash (e.g., `archives/`).
  * `credentials` contains the CLP IAM user's credentials.

## Configuration for stream storage

To configure CLP to cache stream files on S3, update the `stream_output.storage` key in
`<package>/etc/clp-config.yml` with the values in the code block below, replacing the fields in
angle brackets (`<>`) with the appropriate values:

```yaml
stream_output:
  storage:
    type: "s3"
    staging_directory: "var/data/staged-streams"  # Or a path of your choosing
    s3_config:
      region_code: "<region-code>"
      bucket: "<bucket-name>"
      key_prefix: "<key-prefix>"
      credentials:
        access_key_id: "<aws-access-key-id>"
        secret_access_key: "<aws-secret-access-key>"

  # stream_output's other config keys
```

* `staging_directory` is the local filesystem directory where streams will be temporarily stored
  before being uploaded to S3.
* `s3_config` configures both the S3 bucket where streams should be stored and the credentials
  for accessing it.
  * `<region-code>` is the AWS region [code][aws-region-codes] for the bucket.
  * `<bucket-name>` is the bucket's name.
  * `<key-prefix>` is the "directory" where all streams will be stored within the bucket and
    must end with trailing forward slash (e.g., `streams/`).
  * `credentials` contains the CLP IAM user's credentials.

:::{note}
CLP currently doesn't explicitly delete the cached streams. This limitation will be addressed in a
future release.
