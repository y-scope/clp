# Core

CLP core is the low-level component that performs compression, decompression, and search.

## Requirements

* We have built and tested CLP on the OSes listed [below](#native-environment).
  * If you have trouble building for another OS, file an issue, and we may be able to help.
* A recent compiler that fully supports C++20 features such as
  * std::span
* [CMake] >= 3.23.0 and < 4.0.0
  * Minimum version 3.23.0 is required for [yscope-dev-utils].
  * We constrain the version to < 4.0.0 due to [y-scope/clp#795].
* [Task] 3.44.0
  * We pin the version to 3.44.0 due to [y-scope/clp-ffi-js#110].
* [uv] >= 0.8

To build, we require some source dependencies, packages from package managers, and libraries built
from source.

### Set up

To initialize the project, run:

```shell
tools/scripts/deps-download/init.sh
```

### Source Dependencies

To get all dependencies required by CLP core, run the `deps:core` task:

```shell
task deps:core
```

The task will download, build, and install (within the build directory) the following libraries:

### Environment

A handful of packages and libraries are required to build CLP. There are two options to use them:

* Install them on your machine and build CLP natively
* Build CLP within a prebuilt docker container that contains the libraries;
  However, this won't work if you need additional libraries that aren't already in the container.

#### Native Environment

See the relevant README for your OS:

* [CentOS Stream 9](centos-stream-9-deps-install)
* [macOS](macos-deps-install)
* [Ubuntu 22.04](ubuntu-jammy-deps-install)

Want to build natively on an OS not listed here? You can file a [feature request][feature-req].

#### Docker Environment

You can use these commands to start a container in which you can build and run CLP:

```shell
# Make sure to change /path/to/clp/components/core and /path/to/my/logs below
docker run --rm -it \
  --name 'clp-build-env' \
  -u$(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v$(readlink -f /path/to/clp/components/core):/mnt/clp \
  -v$(readlink -f /path/to/my/logs):/mnt/logs \
  ghcr.io/y-scope/clp/clp-core-dependencies-x86-ubuntu-jammy:main \
  /bin/bash -l

cd /mnt/clp
```

Make sure to change `/path/to/clp/components/core` and `/path/to/my/logs` to
the relevant paths on your machine.

## Build

* Configure the cmake project:
  ```shell
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  ```

* Build:
  ```shell
  make -j
  ```

## Test

```shell
task tests:integration:core
```
