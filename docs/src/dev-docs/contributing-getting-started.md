# Getting started

Have an issue you want to fix or a feature you'd like to implement? We'd love to see it!

The general process is as follows:

* Submit a [bug report][bug-report] or [feature request][feature-req] describing the motivation for
  the change and your proposed implementation if any. A CLP maintainer will give you feedback and
  guidance about how to proceed.
* [Fork][clp-fork] the repo.
* Implement your change, adding unit/integration tests where possible.
* Apply the [linters](contributing-linting).
* Submit a pull-request for your change. One or more CLP developers will review your change.
* Respond to the review(s).
