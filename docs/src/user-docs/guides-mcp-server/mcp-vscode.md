# Connecting Visual Studio Code

This guide explains how to connect
[Visual Studio Code(VSCode)][vscode]
 to the CLP MCP server over HTTP.

## Steps

1. Follow the
[official VSCode guide][vscode-guide]
to add an MCP server to VSCode.
2. The json configuration for CLP's MCP should be added to the `servers` object:

    ```json
    "servers": {
       "clp-mcp-server": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "http://<host>:<port>/mcp"
       }
    }
    ```

    The `host` and `port` values should match the hostname and
    port number where the MCP server is running, as
    specified during [configuration](../guides-mcp-server/index.md#starting-the-mcp-server).

3. Once you have added the MCP server, you can
follow
[this section][vscode-using-mcp]
to use the CLP MCP tools in agent mode.
