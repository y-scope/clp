# Schema file syntax

The schema file is used to specify the delimiters and variable patterns for 
compressing and searching logs. Logs are tokenized using delimiters and each 
token is classified as a variable or static text. Variable types are assigned a 
name and a pattern defined by the regex rules in the schema file. Some variable 
names are keywords and variables with these names are treated specially.
Anything not matching a variable type is considered to be static text.

## Example Schema File 

```
// Delimiters
delimiters: \t\r\n:,!;%

// Keywords
timestamp:\d{4}\-\d{2}\-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(\.\d{3}){0,1}
timestamp:\[\d{8}\-\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\]
int:\-{0,1}[0-9]+
float:\-{0,1}[0-9]+\.[0-9]+

// Custom variables
hex:[a-fA-F]+
hasNumber:.*\d.*
equals:.*=.*[a-zA-Z0-9].*
```

* `delimiters: \t\r\n:,!;%` indicates that ` `, `\t`, `\r`, `\n`, `:`, `,`, `!`,
  `;`, `%`, and `'` are delimiters. Note, this is not a regular expression but a 
  collection of characters; every character specified is treated as a delimiter.
  In a log file, consecutive delimiters, e.g., N consecutive spaces, are stored 
  as static text. Currently, at least one delimiter must be specified, and 
  multiple delimiter specifications on separate lines are allowed.
* Keywords and custom variables are designated by specifying
  `typeName:regexPattern` where `typeName` consists of alphanumeric characters
  and is followed by a `:`. `regexPattern` cannot contain delimiters (except
  `timestamp`) as this is currently incompatible with search. The supported
  regex for `regexPattern` is specified in the section below. The same 
  `typeName` may show up on multiple lines allowing for it to be associated
  with multiple `regexPattern` specifications.
  * Although keywords are defined the same as variables, they are treated 
    differently.
  * If a variable in a log matches multiple keyword/variable patterns with 
    different names, the pattern specified earlier in the schema file is 
    prioritized.
* `timestamp` is a keyword and its pattern may contain delimiters. Timestamps at
  the start of a log file or after a newline in a log file indicate the
  beginning of a new log message. If the log file contains no timestamp at the
  start of the file then a newline is used to indicate the beginning of a new
  log message. Timestamp patterns are not matched midline and are not stored as
  dictionary variables as they may contain delimiters.
* `int` and `float` are keywords. These are encoded specially for compression
  performance.

## Supported Regex
```
REGEX RULE   DEFINITION
ab           Match 'a' followed by 'b'
a|b          Match a OR b
[a-z]        Match any character in the brackets (e.g., any lowercase letter)
             - special characters must be escaped, even in brackets (e.g., [\.\(\\])
[^a-zA-Z]    Match any character NOT in the brackets (e.g., non-alphabet character)
a*           Match 'a' 0 or more times
a+           Match 'a' 1 or more times
a{N}         Match 'a' exactly N times
a{N,M}       Match 'a' between N and M times
(abc)        Subexpression (concatenates abc)
\d           Match any digit 0-9
\s           Match any whitespace character (' ', '\r', '\t', '\v', or '\f')
.            Match any *non-delimiter* character
```

## Known issues
Below are current known issues/limitations with schema support. Open an issue on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/y-scope/clp/issues) if you require assistance.

* Wildcard search queries for archives compressed with a schema file currently 
  consider `*` as representing 0 or more non-delimiter characters.
* We currently only support ASCII characters. Future support will include UTF-8
  encodings.
* Timestamps must appear at the start of the message.
* There is currently no way to specify text around a variable that is used for 
  context but is not part of the variable.
