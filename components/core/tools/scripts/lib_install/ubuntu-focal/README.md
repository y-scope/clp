These instructions are used to install the dependencies to build CLP. The same
steps are used by our Docker containers.

# Installing dependencies

Before you run any commands below, you should review the scripts to ensure they
will not install any dependencies you don't expect.

* Install all dependencies:

  ```bash
  ./install-all.sh
  ```

# Building CLP

* See the instructions in the [main README](../../../../README.md#build)
