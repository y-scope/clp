name: "retry-failed-jobs"

# This workflow automatically retries failed jobs from other workflows to handle transient failures
# such as:
# - Runner acquisition timeouts ("The job was not acquired by Runner of type self-hosted even after
#   multiple attempts")
# - Self-hosted runners being temporarily unavailable due to maintenance or failures
#
# How it works:
# 1. Triggers when a monitored workflow completes (success or failure)
# 2. If the workflow failed on its first attempt, re-runs only the failed jobs
# 3. Uses a GitHub-hosted runner to avoid the same runner acquisition issues
#
# To add retry support for another workflow, add its name to the `workflows` list below.
